# PRODUCT ROADMAP

## 2023
![In-111](/assets/images/product/In-111-10px.png){: .align-left}
**Indium-111** is commonly used in Nuclear Medicine Diagnostic Imaging by radiolabeling targeted molecules or cells. During its radioactive decay, 
it emits low energy gamma (γ) photons which can be imaged using planar or Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) gamma cameras (primary energies (ε) of 171.3 keV (91%) and 245.4 keV (94%))

![I-123](/assets/images/product/I-123-10px.png){: .align-left}
**Iodine-123** is a radioactive isotope of iodine used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or SPECT/CT exams. In medical applications, the radiation is detected by a gamma camera. The isotope is typically applied as iodide-123, the anionic form.

![Ge-68](/assets/images/product/Ge-68-10px.png){: .align-left}
**Germanium-68** is used to produce calibration sources for radiometric equipment and PET scanners as well as Ge-68/Ga-68 generators. It decays to the medically useful positron-emitting isotope 68Ga, to obtain images of a specific type of tissue, or disease state of tissue.

![Sr-82](/assets/images/product/Sr-82-10px.png){: .align-left}
**Strontium-82** is used exclusively to manufacture rubidium-82 generators. The generator system makes rubidium-82; the most convenient Positron Emission Tomography (PET) agent in myocardial perfusion imaging.
